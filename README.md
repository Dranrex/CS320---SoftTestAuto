How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through multiples modes of testing, such as White Box and Integration testing, coupled with code review and secure coding practices abiding by the documentation and requirements of the software. The code would follow industry standard coding practices and would be regularly updated to maintain functionality and security.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User Research through surveys and User Stories / Use Cases to help determine what users may seek when interacting with the program. Prototyping the design and gaining feedback as the steps are taken in creating the software will help to determine what needs improvement in design and functionality.

How do I approach designing software?
There are a lot of steps to reliably approach designing software, as I have not done this professionally, I can't attest to that aspect, but theoretically I would do as follows.:
  Acquire Documentation/Requirements
  Prototype Design and Functionality
    Review Prototype and Establish New Expectations and Design
  Modularize the work and develop a schedule
  Test code as work is done
    Test Security and Scalability, if necessary
  Create/Update Documentation as code is finalized
  Test Components Working together (Integration)
  Review Code
  Submit for further review and finalization
  Incorporate final feedback before release
  Release
  Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
